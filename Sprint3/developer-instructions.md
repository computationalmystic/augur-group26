# Augur Installation Instructions
[Click here for instructions](https://github.com/computationalmystic/augur-group26/blob/master/README.md)

Please follow the instructions at the link above, except when you clone the repository to 
your local machine, make sure and use 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/computationalmystic/augur-group26.git
cd augur
make vagrant
```
instead of the repository in the given example.

From there, when you launch augur on your vagrant instance it should show 
our version of augur.

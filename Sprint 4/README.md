Current State of use cases and issues.
At the moment all use cases and issues are closed. We have talked to our stakeholder and he seems very please with the product that has been provided. Of course if there are any further requests we will be more than happy to address them.

Use case 1: Visualization of lines committed per user
User can navigate to "Lines" tab in augur
Graph is shown with data on which users have the most commits for the project
Graph pulls data and is populated
The use case 1 graph is up and operational

Use case 2: Drill-down graph to show more time-specific commit data
User can press button on the previously described graph to show loc/week
Graph pulls the same correct graph data shown but with tighter time restriction
User can navigate back to original graph using an exit button
Graph refreshes and shows original timed data
The use case 2 graph's idea was modified to allow the user to zoom in on the data in the graph. The stakeholder thought is was "really cool".

Use case 3: Detect backend loading failure w/ error code
User receives error code that backend has failed to load when launching augur
Failed backend load is detected and sends an alert box to the view
Eliminates confusion when stuck at loading screen
The use case 3 was determine non effective and it was closed. No further work is expected against it.
